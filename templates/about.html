                East Bristol Hops are always looking for new members.

                Our goal is to become self-sufficient by propagating enough hop plants such that everyone interested in
                joining the association can receive a free plant.
            </p>
            <p class="oldcrewstory">
                Until then, though, we will be placing an order early in the new year.

                If you'd like to join in next year's harvest, please leave your details via the 
                <a class="linksButtons" href="{{ url_for ('contact') }}">Contact tab</a> so we can contact
                you nearer the time regarding how much your plant will cost. As an example, in previous years we have
                charged Â£20 per plant,<br> which includes not only the plant itself but also almost everything else you'll need to
                get set up.<br>

                If you'd like to get involved, but don't have any spare cash, do please still get in touch as we have a
                limited number of plants propagated by our growers which we could donate for free.<br>

            <h1 class="oldcrewheading">Where it all began</h1>
            <p class="oldcrewstory">
                East Bristol Hops was formed in 2016 by four friends who had the idea to bring together a
                community of hop growers in Bristol who collectively would provide green hops to a local brewery for a
                uniquely Bristolian brew.<br>
                Within a few weeks of first talking about the idea, the original team of organisers had a brewery on
                board (Dawkins Ales) and an
                enthusiastic community of growers. That September 7kg of fresh, green hops were harvested and were used
                to make the first edition
                of a beer dubbed Easton Promise, which we launched during Cask Ale Week.

            <p class="oldcrewstory">
                The association has gone from strength to strength since that first year as plants get more established,
                the number of contributors increases
                and the amount of harvested hops increases. In our second year, the harvest was over 20 kilos - a
                significant milestone as it meant the
                2017 beer contained only locally grown cones.
                Bringing together people with a passion for beer, small breweries and their community has been the chief
                goal of the association since its inception. <br> If you'd like to get involved, please get in touch via
