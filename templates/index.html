                So what's it all about?
            </p>
            <p>
                Well good question, its all about the hops and beer, but mostly hops, whether in pots or in the ground on our allotments, balconies, gardens
                pretty much anywhere hops will grow.<br>
                More info about growing hops can be found on our <a class="wikilinkinline" href="{{ url_for ('wiki')}}">HopsWiki.</a>
            </p>
            <p>
                Everyone who gets involved will get to join a community of growers, the simple pleasure of watching
                the hop mature, and the joy of harvesting it on the same day as everyone else and adding it to the brew. 
            </p>
            <p> Beer is usually made with dried hops or compressed dried pellets.
                Green hop ale is unusual because the hops start to lose their oils and flavours as soon as they are
                picked,<br> so they need to go from vine to brewing kettle in hours. 
            </p>
            <p>
                But if you can find good local
                hops, you’ll be able to brew a unique
                beer with a very special taste. <br>
                By early autumn we’ll get to sample our own - free pints at a party as soon as it’s brewed, and a
                special discount on some more.
            </p>
            <p>    
               Whats more you’ll also be able to wander into your local and buy a pint that you helped make.

                    The recipe is somewhat of a secret, as it changes year on year, but we Promise you its good!
                    What we can tell you, is that Dawkins expertly craft our hops into this fantastic beer. 
                </p>
                <p>    
                    It's packed full of locally-grown 
                    wet Bullion, Fuggles, Primadonna (UK) hops, Its Super-fresh, grassy, hoppy flavours are only possible, due to the hops being 
                    picked straight off the vine capturing all the delicate volatile aromas from the natural hop oils.
                    Whats the ABV? <br> Well, this is a concept beer so we'll let you know when we know!
