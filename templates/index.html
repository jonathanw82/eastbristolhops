                So what's it all about?
            </p>
            <p>
                Well, good question, it's all about hops and beer, but mostly hops, whether in pots or in the ground, on
                our allotments, balconies, gardens, pretty much anywhere hops will grow we will grow it.<br>
                More information on growing hops can be found on our <a class="wikilinkinline"
                    href="{{ url_for ('wiki')}}">HopsWiki.</a>
            </p>
            <p>
                Everyone who gets involved will get to join a community of growers, the simple pleasure of watching
                the hop mature, and the joy of harvesting it on the same day as everyone else and adding it to the brew.
            </p>
            <p> Beer is usually made with dried hops or compressed dried pellets.
                Green hop ale is unusual because the hops start to lose their oils and flavours as soon as they are
                picked,<br> so they need to go from vine to brewing kettle in hours.

            <p>
                But if you can find good local
                hops, you’ll be able to brew a unique
                beer with a very special taste. <br>
                By early autumn we’ll get to sample our own - free pints at a party as soon as it’s brewed, and a
                special discount on some more.
            </p>
            <p>
                What's more, you’ll also be able to wander into your local pub and buy a pint that you helped make.
